    "\n",
    "Typically the **Z-space** is highly **entangled**, i.e. same features of the z-vector have an impace to different output features. This is due to the nature of neuronal nets. This is a very common problem when the Z space doesn't have enough **dimensions** relative to the number of features you want to control in the output because then it actually can't **map things one-to-one**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means, that it is **not possible to control single output features**.\n",
    "\n",
    "A way to mitigate this is by using a **pre-trained classifier** for the desired output features which can be used to find the correct directions in the Z-Sapce. To find these directions, the updates are done just to the **noise vector**."
